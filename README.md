## DEPRECATED 
**This is not the repo for my current portfolio site.** It was built as an exercise in refactoring vanilla HTML, JS & CSS into a SPA-style React app. To view my portfolio, please visit [metcalf.dev](https://metcalf.dev), which remains a simple vanilla site!

## Description
This is a constantly updated and evolving portfolio, serving as an introduction to my work and progress in full stack development. This currently uses **React, Bootstrap, and custom stylesheets.**

## Installation
If you are interested, feel free to clone this repo and use it for inspiration in your own portfolio. Though I doubt that is why you are here viewing this README. Thanks by the way for checking out my work!

## Usage
For now, this is a purely frontend experience, allowing the user to view relevant information about my work, my background and some contact points.
