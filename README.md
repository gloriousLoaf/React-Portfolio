## Description
To view my portfolio, please visit [metcalf.dev](https://metcalf.dev).
This is a constantly updated and evolving portfolio, serving as an introduction to my work and progress in full stack development. This currently uses **Bootstrap, jQuery, Owl Carousel, and custom JavaScript & stylesheet.**
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation
If you are interested, feel free to clone this repo and use it for inspiration in your on portfolio. Though I doubt that is why you are here viewing this README. Thanks by the way for checking out my work!
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
For now, this is a purely frontend experience, allowing the user to view relevant information. The next reworking will deploy a database to handle user contacts sent through the page.
